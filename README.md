## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- Iâ€™m currently working on [LiOS](https://github.com/glolichen/lios), a x86-64 operating system written from scratch (name change incoming)
- Iâ€™m currently learning about operating systems, Rust and LaTeX
- Fun fact: I have completed 1+ year of [math homework](https://github.com/glolichen/peddie-math) in LaTeX
